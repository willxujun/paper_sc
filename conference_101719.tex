\begin{abstract}
As quantum computing gains traction, there is a significant effort in applying it to real-world problems. One of the approaches is to use quantum annealing for the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), which in turn has a wide range of applications. However, practical QAPs are often large because the size of a QAP increases quadratically with respect to the number of "items to be assigned". As a result, state-of-the-art quantum(-inspired) annealers, with their limited number of qubits, lack scalability. This paper proposes a new heuristic that enables quantum(-inspired) annealers to solve QAPs of size linear to the number of qubits, provided a certain block-structural property is satisfied. Such property is frequently observed in practical settings such as warehouse allocation. The heuristic is implemented on Fujitsu Digital Annealer (DA), a dedicated quantum-inspired CMOS device that implements annealing. Experiments are performed on standard QAPLIB datasets and randomly generated block-structural QAP instances, and performance is compared against conventional methods such as software simulated annealing. Results demonstrate that the new heuristic 1) produces solutions of comparable quality on standard QAPs, 2) produces superior solutions for block-structural QAPs as well as for warehouse allocation and 3) DA achieves substantial speedup compared to conventional methods. Therefore, via the new heuristic, quantum(-inspired) annealers can effectively solve block-structural QAPs of large sizes and can be applied to practical problems.

\section{Introduction}
Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is a well-known combinatorial optimisation problem with a wide range of applications, such as backboard wiring, statistical analysis, placement of electronic components, etc.
QAP can be visualised as the problem of assigning $n$ facilities to $n$ locations. There is a flow between each pair of facilities and a distance between each pair of locations. The aim is to find an assignment of the facilities to the locations such that the sum of all products of flows and their corresponding distances is minimised, subject to the constraints that each facility is assigned to exactly one location and each location contains exactly one facility. Formally, if flow is given as the matrix $(f_{ij})$ and distance is given as the matrix $(d_{kl})$, then the objective function to minimise is \[\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\sum_{l=1}^{n}f_{ij}d_{kl}x_{ik}x_{jl}\] subject to \begin{align}
\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{ik}=1 \qquad \forall 1\leq i \leq n \label{ct1}\\
\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{ik}=1 \qquad \forall 1\leq k \leq n \label{ct2}
\end{align}
$x_{ik}$ is the binary decision variable representing whether facility $i$ goes to location $k$.

QAP is computationally difficult because it is NP-hard. Except for very small instances (n<15?) which can be solved with exact algorithms, most practical instances are intractable to exact algorithms and various heuristics are used to produce solutions of decent quality with short computation time. For example, ().

Some of the heuristics listed above are amenable to hardware acceleration. For example, ().

Quantum(-inspired) annealer is a relatively new kind of hardware that could accelerate QAP. A Quantum annealer works by introducing a problem Hamiltonian, which contains biases and couplings between qubits, to the initial Hamiltonian[]. The energy stay at minimum throughout the annealing process. At the end of annealing, the system is in the eigenstate of the problem Hamiltonian and the qubits are in their classical states.

In order to enable quantum annealing of a QAP, the problem must first be converted into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) form[], which effectively means constraints \eqref{ct1} and \eqref{ct2} have to be subsumed as part of the objective function in some way. It is customary to do this by encoding the constraints as quadratic penalty terms which augment the objective function. It can be shown that for QUBOs, the optimal solution to the augmented objective function also minimises the original objective function [].

However, state-of-the-art quantum annealers lack scalability for QAPs of practical sizes. Whereas QAPs in research literature are often experimental in size, ranging from several tens of variables to at most over two hundred variables, practical QAPs can be way larger. For instance, a warehouse can have hundreds of locations, and the number of decision variables in a derived QAP is easily in the range of $10^4$. More importantly, the number of decision variables is $O(n^2)$ with respect to the number of items to be assigned. Meanwhile, modern quantum annealers only support a small number of qubits, with each qubit corresponding to a decision variable. The D-Wave quantum annealer uses over 2000 qubits, but its \textit{chimera} architecture, where qubits are arranged in connected clusters of 8, limits the maximum number of nodes in a fully-connected problem graph to around 64 []. Increasing this number requires the graph to be sparser, but actual graph density depends on application and sparsity is not guaranteed. Quantum-inspired technologies are better off but not fully capable. For example, Fujitsu Digital Annealer (DA) is a quantum-inspired CMOS ASIC which implements annealing, and it supports over 8000 variables with full connectivity. This means a naive QAP implementation has a maximum size of nearly 90 variables. However, this is still too small to satisfy the high demands of problem size in practical QAPs.

This paper deals with QAPs having a particular block-structure. In particular, the set of variables in the distance matrix can be split into intervals such that distance between locations in the same interval is relatively small, and distance between locations in different intervals is larger. This pattern is observed in our case study of warehouse management, where locations are organised into columns which correspond with intervals. It is easy to travel within a column, but crossing over to another column will require traversing longer distances.

This paper presents a novel divide-and-conquer heuristic that takes advantage of the above block-structure. Combining a maximum k-cut on frequency matrix with a minimum k-cut on distance matrix, the original QAP can be meaningfully divided into sub-problems and each sub-problem will have a size that is $O(n)$ to the number of items. This makes the overall QAP amenable to solving on a quantum device.

This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes different aspects of related work. Section 3 elaborates on QAP and gives a more precise definition of the block-structural property. Section 4 explains the new divide-and-conquer heuristic. Section 5 describes experimental setup and computational results. Section 6 discusses some issues and points to future research. Section 7 concludes.

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Decomposition Methods}
There are two levels at which a problem can be decomposed. The first level is higher at QAP, while the second is the more primitive QUBO.

\subsection{Use of Quantum Devices}



\section{Ease of Use}

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
Please do not revise any of the current designations.

\section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
proofreading, spelling and grammar.

Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
for you.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to go through the file line by line.

Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
counting.

{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3. 

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
surrounding equation.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

\subsection{Identify the Headings}
Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
should be introduced.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\end{figure}

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
