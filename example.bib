abstract = "GPU hardware and CUDA architecture provide a powerful platform to develop parallel algorithms. Implementation of heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms on GPUs are limited in literature. Nowadays developing parallel algorithms on GPU becomes very important. In this paper, NP-Hard Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) that is one of the combinatorial optimization problems is discussed. Parallel Multistart Simulated Annealing (PMSA) method is developed with CUDA architecture to solve QAP. An efficient method is developed by providing multistart technique and cooperation between threads. The cooperation is occurred with threads in both the same and different blocks. This paper focuses on both acceleration and quality of solutions. Computational experiments conducted on many Quadratic Assignment Problem Library (QAPLIB) instances. The experimental results show that PMSA runs up to 29x faster than a single-core CPU and acquires best known solution in a short time in many benchmark datasets."

Combinatorial optimization problems, such as the traveling salesman problem, maximal clique and graph partitioning can be formulated as a QAP. In this paper, we present some of the most important QAP formulations and classify them according to their mathematical sources. We also present a discussion on the theoretical resources used to define lower bounds for exact and heuristic algorithms. We then give a detailed discussion of the progress made in both exact and heuristic solution methods, including those formulated according to metaheuristic strategies.

abstract = "Multi-start methods strategically sample the solution space of an optimization problem. The most successful of these methods have two phases that are alternated for a certain number of global iterations. The first phase generates a solution and the second seeks to improve the outcome. Each global iteration produces a solution that is typically a local optimum, and the best overall solution is the output of the algorithm. The interaction between the two phases creates a balance between search diversification (structural variation) and search intensification (improvement), to yield an effective means for generating high-quality solutions. This survey briefly sketches historical developments that have motivated the field, and then focuses on modern contributions that define the current state-of-the-art. We consider two categories of multi-start methods: memory-based and memoryless procedures. The former are based on identifying and recording specific types of information (attributes) to exploit in future constructions. The latter are based on order statistics of sampling and generate unconnected solutions. An interplay between the features of these two categories provides an inviting area for future exploration."

The CVD data for Boltzmann machines are generated by reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations. The Boltzmann machines give insight into the semiconducting (2H) and metallic (1T) phases and defects generated during the CVD growth of MoS2. We compare the performances of the two types of Boltzmann machine models, i.e. RBM versus augmented topologies with limited intra-layer coupling between the hidden units (LBM). We show that limited topologies have a performance advantage over restricted topologies. We examine connectivity within our topological variants, explore hardware qubit mapping schemes, and discuss what performance differences may imply about locality within the data without prior knowledge."

Here, we introduce a codification of the cryptographically relevant constraints in the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian, allowing us to naturally encode it in a quantum annealer, which seems to provide a quantum speedup. Additionally, we benchmark small n cases in a D-Wave machine, showing its capacity of devising cryptographic Boolean functions with certain relevant properties. We have complemented it with local search and chain repair to improve the D-Wave quantum annealer performance related to the low connectivity. This work shows how to codify super-exponential cryptographic problems into quantum annealers and paves the way for reaching quantum supremacy."

The method is applied to both synthetic data and real data obtained from biology experiments. We find that the quantum annealer produces an ensemble of different solutions that often generalizes better to unseen data than the single global minimum of an SVM trained on a conventional computer, especially in cases where only limited training data is available. For cases with more training data than currently fits on the quantum annealer, we show that a combination of classifiers for subsets of the data almost always produces stronger joint classifiers than the conventional SVM for the same parameters."

Systems of polynomial equations are ubiquitous in computational science, with major applications in machine learning and computer security (i.e., model fitting and integer factorization). The proposed methodology maps the squared-error function for a polynomial equation onto the Ising-Hamiltonian model, ensuring that the approximate solutions (by least squares) to real-world problems can be computed on a quantum annealer even when the exact solutions do not exist. Hamiltonians for integer factorization and polynomial systems of equations are implemented and analyzed for both logical optimality and physical practicality on modern quantum annealing hardware.},

Many classical search methods have been developed in order to tackle this problem. However, the availability of quantum computing architectures has given us the opportunity to address this problem with new (quantum) techniques. This paper describes a quantum isomer search procedure for determining all the structural isomers of alkanes. We first formulate the structural isomer search problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. The QUBO formulation is for general use on either annealing or gate-based quantum computers. We use the D-Wave quantum annealer to enumerate all structural isomers of all alkanes with fewer carbon atoms (n < 10) than Decane (C10H22). The number of isomer solutions increases with the number of carbon atoms. We find that the sampling time needed to identify all solutions scales linearly with the number of carbon atoms in the alkane. We probe the problem further by employing reverse annealing as well as a perturbed QUBO Hamiltonian and find that the combination of these two methods significantly reduces the number of samples required to find all isomers.},

This problem is known as community detection, and has become very important in various fields of science including chemistry, biology and social sciences. The problem of community detection is a twofold problem that consists of determining the number of communities and, at the same time, finding those communities. This drastically increases the solution space for heuristics to work on, compared to traditional graph partitioning problems. In many of the scientific domains in which graphs are used, there is the need to have the ability to partition a graph into communities with the ‚Äúhighest quality‚Äù possible since the presence of even small isolated communities can become crucial to explain a particular phenomenon. We have explored community detection using the power of quantum annealers, and in particular the D-Wave 2X and 2000Q machines. It turns out that the problem of detecting at most two communities naturally fits into the architecture of a quantum annealer with almost no need of reformulation. This paper addresses a systematic study of detecting two or more communities in a network using a quantum annealer.},

    abstract = { This paper introduces and illustrates an efficient algorithm, called the sweep algorithm, for solving medium- as well as large-scale vehicle-dispatch problems with load and distance constraints for each vehicle. The locations that are used to make up each route are determined according to the polar-coordinate angle for each location. An iterative procedure is then used to improve the total distance traveled over all routes. The algorithm has the feature that the amount of computation required increases linearly with the number of locations if the average number of locations for each route remains relatively constant. For example, if the average number of locations per route is 7.5, the algorithm takes approximately 75 seconds to solve a 75-location problem on an IBM 360/67 and approximately 115 seconds to solve a 100-location problem. In contrast, the time to solve a problem with a fixed number of locations increases quadratically with the average number of locations per route. The sweep algorithm generally produces results that are significantly better than those produced by Gaskell's savings approach and are generally slightly better than Christofides and Eilon's results; however, the sweep algorithm is not as computationally efficient as Gaskell's and is slightly less so than Christofides and Eilon's. }
